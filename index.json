[{"categories":["Privilege Identity Management","Azure AD"],"contents":"Entra ID PIM is a great security tool if used correctly. But I often see how it\u0026rsquo;s not well configured. That makes me sad when an organization has the opportunity to improve its security posture, but lacks the insight or knowledge of the potential protection available or even lives in a false sense of protection.\nThe most critical accounts in the tenant must be protected at all costs, the security risk on these accounts is inherited down on all other resources and services in the tenant.\nBack in 2021, I wrote the blog post Exposing Azure AD Roles with privileged access groups where I identified the possibility of nesting a standard security group in a role assignable group. After that, I reached out to the Microsoft Security Response Center to inform them about this breach in privileged security zones.\nIn this post, I would like to highlight and re-iterate the problem I see and show you how to use the tool PIMSCAN to identify the problem, which is not trivial using the portal.\nWhat do I mean by a breach in a privileged security zone?\nThere are actions in Entra ID identity management that are classified as \u0026ldquo;sensitive actions\u0026rdquo; https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions\nIn short the following situations only Privileged Auth Admin and Global Admin can manage the sensitive actions as a protection from privileged escalation. See table below:\nRole that sensitive action can be performed upon Auth Admin User Admin Privileged Auth Admin Global Admin Global Admin ✅ ✅ Privileged Auth Admin ✅ ✅ Privileged Role Admin ✅ ✅ User (no admin role, but member or owner of a role-assignable group) ✅ ✅ User with a role scoped to a restricted management administrative unit ✅ ✅ All custom roles ✅ ✅ Table from: Privileged roles and permissions in Microsoft Entra ID (preview)\nIn my opinion, this is a sort of privileged access security zone created around the principals that are classified in the filtered table above.\nThis is the zone that could have exposure to non-members of Privileged Auth Admin and Global Admin.\nThe reason is already mentioned in my previous blog post but I will further clarify the situation and explain how it can be abused.\nThe introduction of role-assignable groups was a long-requested feature to simplify the management of role assignments.\nThe following picture shows that a security group, if created as a role-assignable group (isRoleAssignable=True), can be either eligible or active in a role and the group is protected in the sensitive actions - zone.\nWhile introducing the option of creating groups that can be assigned to a role, it was not supposed to be able to nest standard groups into role-assignable groups.\nIt is not possible with one exception. A standard group can be eligible for a role-assignable group.\nThis means that members of the standard group can activate membership in the role-assignable group.\nTyranny of the default There are a couple of settings in Entra ID that have an impact on this scenario.\nThe settings are the following:\nSetting Tenant Global Value The Default Value Owern Self Management Yes Yes Yes PIM Role - Approval required No (per role) No No PIM Group - Approval required No (per group) No No Owern Self Management An owner of a group can manage the membership of the group.\nPIM Role Approval Requirement All roles have a role policy settings that by default do not have an approver. In my opinion it would have been great if the Global Administrators where the default approvers until it was change to another group or user.\nPIM Group Approval Requirement All groups have two role policy settings, one for members and one for owners, that by default do not have an approver.\nThe default settings mean there is no actual protection from getting access to any role unless the role settings have been modified. PIM is just providing temporary access at most in this situation for 8 hours. An attacker that has made an account take-over has no limitations in abusing the assigned roles, active or eligible.\nATTACK PATH The combination of the default settings and making a standard security group eligible is a risky combination, that creates an exposure for the elevation of privileges. This situation makes the security zone around sensitive actions exposed to less privileged security principals.\nHere is a list of edges in the attack path:\nEdge Steps Action isMember 2 Elevate to isRoleAssignabelGroup -\u0026gt; Elevate to role isOwner 3 Make itself a member of the group -\u0026gt; Elevate to isRoleAssignabelGroup -\u0026gt; Elevate to role Has Add_Member 3 Make itself a member of the group -\u0026gt; Elevate to isRoleAssignabelGroup -\u0026gt; Elevate to role Has Add_Owner 3 Make itself a member of the group -\u0026gt; Elevate to isRoleAssignabelGroup -\u0026gt; Elevate to role The permissions Add_Member or Add_Owner is pretty common.\nHere is the attack path visualized:\nMSRC I reported this issue to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in November 2023.\nThe response from Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) on the 23rd of November in 2023 was the following:\nQuote MRSC:\n\u0026ldquo;We determined that this behavior is considered to be by design.\u0026rdquo;\nI guess this means this attack vector will remain open and the organization needs to turn on approval flows to keep it in control or move the standard security group to a restricted management administration unit.\nPIMSCAN Introducing the PowerShell tool PIMSCAN.\nBy using the tool PIMSCAN you can unfold the nesting and identify the breach of the sensitive actions security zone.\nThe tool is located in my GitHub repo:\nhttps://github.com/canix1/PIMSCAN\nThe purpose of the tool is to give users a better understanding of the role assignment.\nTo identify the scenario described above, look for nested groups where Priv Mgmt is false.\nWhen Priv Mgmt is false, it means the object can be managed by other than members of Privileged Auth Admin and Global Admin.\nHere is an example of the role Global Administrator having a nested standard security group called Entra ID Sec Group1 and it\u0026rsquo;s a member and an owner.\nRecommendation If you are using Microsoft Entra ID PIM, be aware of that there is no protection from abuse unless you have defined an approver on the role or nested role-assignable group.\nI strongly recommend that all roles be configured with approvers.\nDo not make a standard group eligible to a role-assignable group that is active or eligible for a role. This is breaking the sensitive action protection implemented by Microsoft.\nIf you must use a standard security group as eligible for a role-assignable group, put the standard security group in a restricted management administration unit.\nMake sure all role activations require Azure MFA\nRegularly review role assignments, active and eligible\nRegularly review the approvers, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to require approval without an approver.\nMonitor Entra ID PIM for strange behaviors.\n","permalink":"https://mprivdev.github.io/blog/breaching-the-sensitive-action-zone-in-entra-id-pim/","tags":["Entra ID","API"],"title":"Breaching the sensitive action zone in Entra ID PIM"},{"categories":["Forest Security Boundary","AD"],"contents":"In the article SID filter as security boundary between domains? (Part 7) - Trust account attack - from trusting to trusted , by Jonas Bülow Knudsen, Martin Sohn Christensen, Tobias Thorbjørn Munch Torp, they describe how the security boundary of the forest can be breached by an admin in the trusted forest and I will explain how you can mitigate this problem.\nNOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY This topic has been discussed in the previous blog post Not A Security Boundary: Breaking Forest Trusts by Will Schroeder @harmj0y but I will focus on the scenario described in SID filter as security boundary between domains? (Part 7) - Trust account attack - from trusting to trusted.\nWhen you set up a trust with another forest and specifically only want your users to access the resource in the other domain and not the other way around, that’s a one-way trust. You are the trusted part in this one-way trust and the other side is the trusting part. In most cases, you do not want to expose any directory information to the trusting side of the trust, since you do not trust or can control the security of that forest. The reason for the trust can be many but often organizations are in a situation where you need to migrate from one domain to another. Setting up this trust helps move resources to the destination domain. The old domain could contain a lot of legacy configurations and have a very poor security posture. Sometimes the old domain is managed by a third party that you do not trust. Microsoft has for a very long time presented the idea of the forest as the security boundary, but research by @Jonas_B_K, @martinsohndk, and Tobias Thorbjørn Munch Torp has shown that if you introduce a trust, even a one-way trust you have exposed yourself to the trusting part.\nPROBLEM The problem is very well documented in SID filter as security boundary between domains? (Part 7) - Trust account attack - from trusting to trusted.\nBut in short, a domain administrator in the trusting domain (Domain B) have has access to the password for the trust account, since it’s the responsibility of the domain controller in the trusting domain (Domain B) to maintain it, it is this domain controller that shares its information with the other domain. The trust account is represented in the trusted domain (Domain A) as a user account in the Users container. Let’s say the trusting domain (Domain B) is called managedpriv.com then the user account would be called MANAGEDPRIV$.\nUsing this account an administrator in the trusting domain (Domain B) can access the trusted domain (Domain A) as a normal user. This account is a member of the Domain Users group, and this can’t be changed so hopefully, you have not added Domain Users to any other group, this is a very bad practice by the way.\nThe trust account is a critical system object and means that it’s managed by the system and very few changes can be made to it. You can see that it’s a critical object by checking the attribute isCriticalSystemObject = True. You can’t for example disable the account to prevent it from being used. You can’t remove the membership from Domain Users via modifying the attribute primaryGroupID.\nSOLUTION So, what can we do to make sure no authentication can be made with this account from anywhere? We can turn off authentication by using an Authentication Policy (Authentication Policies and Authentication Policy Silos | Microsoft Learn).\nAuthentication Policy is a feature introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2 and is intended to limit where privileged accounts can be used.\nBy creating an Authentication Policy in the trusted domain (Domain A) that requires the account to only allow authentication from machines in an empty/non-existing Authentication Policy Silo the domain controllers will prevent any authentication using the account.\nThis is how it works when no protection is added to the trust account. In the trusting domain (Domain B) managedpriv.com we can as a domain admin extract the NTLM hash (rc4_hmac_nt) using mimikatz.\n.\\mimikatzs.exe \u0026#34;lsadump::trust /patch\u0026#34; Next, we use Rubeus with the NTLM hash in a Pass-the-hash attack on the same machine, towards the domain controller in the trusted domain (Domain A) contoso.com.\n.\\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:\u0026lt;trust account\u0026gt; /domain:\u0026lt;trusted domain\u0026gt; /dc:\u0026lt;dc in trusted domain\u0026gt; /rc4:\u0026lt;NTLM hash\u0026gt; /ptt Now we have access and can for example search the trusted domain (Domain A) contoso.com.\nGet-aduser -ldapfilter “(servicePrincipalName=*)” -server \u0026lt;DC in trusted domain\u0026gt; | ft How it looks like when the trust account is protected First, we need to create an Authentication Policy and optionally an Authentication Policy Silo just to make sure the rule in the Authentication Policy points to something that exists.\nThe condition for the Authentication Policy dictates the following requirement for authentication:\nThe user must have a matching Authentication Silo claim with the host, called Block_INBOUND_TrustUsers_Logon_Silo.\nIt’s not required to enable support for Claims on the KDC (Domain Controller) or the Kerberos client since failure is the goal.\nI have built a script for this Block-InboundOneWayTrustAccount.ps1 https://github.com/canix1/Block-InboundOneWayTrustAccount. The tool list all one-way inbound trusts and check if the trust account is protected with an Authentication Policy. If there are one-way inbound trusts and the trust accounts is are not protected, you will be asked for each account if you like to protect it.\n.\\Block-InboundOneWayTrustAccount.ps1 -protect In this case, I want to protect the trust account for the one-way trust with managedpriv.com. As shown below I’m skipping the trust with the domain exchange.lab just for showing you can. I also have other trusts in this domain, but they are a child domain (Within Forest) and a bi-directional external trust, and these types of trusts are ignored by the script.\nNow let’s make a new attempt from the trusting domain (Domain B) managedpriv.com to perform a Pass-the-hash attack.\nThe attack failed since the trust account is blocked from any authentication.\nSUCCESS!\nTo revert the changes, we made we can run:\n.\\Block-InboundOneWayTrustAccount.ps1 -unprotect SUMMARY The forest is not the security boundary if you are using trusts unless additional hardening is made.\nWhen you have a one-way trust, you are not protected from admins in the other forest from accessing your forest.\nYou must block authentication for the trust account to prevent admins in the trusting domain (Domain B) to abuse it.\nPassword rotation of the trust account, which happens every 30 days, is not affected since the domain controller in the trusting domain (Domain B) pushes this out to the PDC Emulator in the trusted domain (Domain A) using the function NetrServerPasswordSet2 over RPC.\nReferences SID filter as security boundary between domains?

I will especially focus on when you can use the just-in-time privilege access feature in Privilege Identity Management (PIM). With the preview function Privileged access groups there is more opportunities to make use of the awesome features of PIM. I will discuss a couple of scenarios where this might not be such a good idea.\nPrivilege access groups Privileged access groups is a cool feature that allows you to create new groups that are protected from normal group management i.e. only Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator can managed the members. You also get the same role settings like Azure AD roles have.\nBut there is a big difference! These groups have owners that can manage the group, but the owners do not have to be a member of any privileged group at all.\nThese Azure AD groups are either security groups or Microsoft 365 groups, that have been enabled for Azure AD roles can be assigned to the group. What happens is that the group get its property isAssignableToRole set to true. You can only enable this feature while creating the group.\nPowerShell example Creating a Microsoft 365 group that is assignable to roles.\nNew-AzureADMSGroup -DisplayName \u0026#34;AAD M365 Group /w AAD Role\u0026#34; -Description \u0026#34;This group is assigned to Helpdesk Administrator built-in role in Azure AD.\u0026#34; -MailEnabled $true -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName \u0026#34;AADM365Group/wAADRole\u0026#34; -IsAssignableToRole $true Note: Your PIM instance must have been upgraded to support privileged access groups.

If you try to change this value for an existing group, you will get this error:\nValue for IsAssignableToRole cannot be updated for groups assignable to role. There is a maximum number of 251 for role-assignable groups per Azure AD tenant.\nWhen an Azure AD group is enabled for privileged access management you can manage the members or the owners through PIM and select between active or eligible access.\nMember types There are three states in which an object can be member of a group in a scenario where PIM has been deployed. These are the three different states:\nEligible - The member has to take actions to activate the privilege access.\nActive - The member doesn’t need to perform any action to active the privilege access.\nDirect membership - This means that the member has been added to the group or role outside of PIM. PIM cannot manage the membership with just-in-time access. This type of membership is either Assigned or Dynamic.\nWhat different objects can have members in Azure you might ask?\nObjects that can have members:\nAzure AD Roles Azure AD Custom Roles Azure AD Security Group Azure AD Security Group Synced Azure AD Microsoft 365 Group Azure Roles Azure Custom Roles Membership by object type Below is a matrix of the different memberships that can take place in Azure and through PIM. I have found that Azure AD Custom Roles and Azure Custom Roles behave the same as built in roles so custom roles do not have an own column.\nColumn headings represent the objects that can have members. Table rows contain the objects that are potential members.\n**Updated 26 Mars 2021\nPossible member AAD Role Az Role AAD Security Group *AAD Security Group /W AAD Roles AAD M365 Group *AAD M365 Group /W AAD Roles Synced Group User P P D P D P - Synced User P P D P D P D AAD Role - - - - - - - AZ Role - - - - - - - ADD Security Group - P D P - P - AAD Security Group /W AAD Roles P P D P - P - AAD M365 Group - P - P - P - AAD M365 Group /W AAD Roles P P - P - P - Synced Group - P D P - P - P = Active/eligible assignment possible with PIM D = Direct member only, PIM not supported - = Cannot be a member * = /W AAD Roles is the Azure AD roles can be assigned to the group setting that enables an Azure AD group for privilege access. This is a preview feature at the time of writing. Nesting scenario Microsoft suggest some scenarios in the article Management capabilities for privileged access Azure AD groups (preview) about privileged access groups\nVisibility Lost Even though this is a totally legitimate scenario it might not be the best option from a security perspective…\nWhy?\nAzure AD Privilege Identity Manager has lost visibility in who has role memberships.\nBellow you can see that PIM tells you that Global Administrator has 1 eligible and 1 active member.\nThis is not true!\nThere are in fact 4 Global Administrator\u0026rsquo;s.\n1 permanent account and 3 eligible accounts.\nLet us go through why.\nThe account myga is a permanent member of Global Administrator, which is visualized by PIM’s dashboard.\nGlobal Administrator has also an “IsAssignableToRole”-enabled group called AAD Security Group /w AAD Role as eligible member, which is also visualized by PIM’s dashboard.\nWhen we examine the members of AAD Security Group /w AAD Role we see that is has a standard security group as eligible member.\nThis is where PIM lost it.\nThe nesting is not calculated in the PIM dashboard.\nAnd if we look at the group AAD Security Group we see it has three direct members. Also not calculated by the PIM dashboard.\nPossible Attack Path When you create complex schemes for you privileged access you might lose insight and control on \u0026ldquo;who can do what\u0026rdquo;.\nIf Anna is made owner for AAD Security Group or if she would be Group Administrator, she could add members to AAD Security Group. Any Member of AAD Security Group can activate access to AAD Security Group /W AAD Role.\nLet say Anna put her own account in to this group in AAD Security Group and activate AAD Security Group /W AAD Role in PIM.\nNow she can activate the Global Administrator role since AAD Security Group /W AAD Role is eligible to it.\nPossible Attack Path - Example Needless to say, we expose the highly privileged roles managed by PIM in a new way when nesting with privileged access groups or standard groups for that matter too.\nExposure araises from the fact that:\n- Owner of a privilged access group or standard group..\n- does not follow the role requirements or process in PIM - does not require any privilged group - Nesting groups in roles moves the control to other admins outside of PIM\nI draw a simple Bloodhound-like attack graph bellow go give you an example of control paths that exist. This picture is far from the full graph of possible attack paths.\n**Updated 26 Mars 2021\nConclusion It is crucial that administrators understand all the ways to control objects and how the tools work. Because if they don\u0026rsquo;t , they might introduce new weaknesses in the design.\nHere are a few things to consider into your design:\nnesting groups in roles make PIM loose visibility nesting groups in roles moves the control to other admins outside of PIM privileged access groups can be nested privileged access groups have owners if synced groups are nested in to privileged access groups or Azure roles the control is moved to on-premise Active Directory References Use cloud groups to manage role assignments in Azure Active Directory (preview)\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept\nManagement capabilities for privileged access Azure AD groups (preview) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/groups-features\nBloodHound\nhttps://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound\n","permalink":"https://mprivdev.github.io/blog/azure-ad-group-nesting/","tags":["Azure AD","Privilege Access","PIM"],"title":"Exposing Azure AD Roles with privileged access groups"},{"categories":["ACL","GPO","AD ACL Scanner","Active Directory"],"contents":"In the previous post Part 1 I introduced a way to detect a malicious actor account in the access control list of the domain root. In this post I will show you how to identify persistence and privilege creep on a domain via Group Policy permissions.\nGroup Policies controls your environment and settings so any control over a GPO linked to a scope of management that covers any computer or user gives the attacker an extremely powerful tool and possibilities to pursue the objectives.\nThe most obvious locations where you should have monitoring turned on and absolute control of are:\nDomain root Domain Controllers organizational unit Any accounts having control over group policies at these locations owns the domain! These accounts are Tier 0 accounts and should be treated as the same.\nIf you are not familiar with the Tier Model and Active Directory you must read up on it.

The user joe, a disgruntled employee, had unintentional control over the domain controllers.\nConclusion Create a clear picture of your current security posture and make sure your SIEM create incidents for modifications of sensitive ACL\u0026rsquo;s and groups.\n","permalink":"https://mprivdev.github.io/blog/finding-highly-privileged-accounts-in-acls---part-2/","tags":["GPO","Security","Active directory","ACL","Assessment","Privileged Account"],"title":"Finding Highly Privileged Accounts in ACL's - Part 2 - GROUP POLICY"},{"categories":["ACL","AD ACL Scanner","Active Directory"],"contents":"When trying to identify the highly privileged accounts in an Active Directory you might start with the members of the built-in administrative groups like Domain Admin etc. But you cannot stop there since there are many places you can grant accounts permissions and privileges throughout an Active Directory Forest. I will not list all possible locations where permissions can make an account a high value target for an attacker but instead focus on a method to detect highly privileged accounts in access control lists (ACL) on Active Directory objects.\nA long time ago I wrote a blog post on examples of these objects in Active Directory where you should pay extra attention: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/pfesweplat/forensics-active-directory-acl-investigation\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start off with an obvious example… the domain root. If a group of users has powerful permissions at the domain root they can practice their given right on all the objects below, except for the ones that are protected by AdminSDHolder. Normally you do not need to delegate permission at this level, even though it\u0026rsquo;s very common because it\u0026rsquo;s convenient and easy. Best practice is to delegate permissions at the domain level that only can be delegated here and delegate all other permissions on an OU level, near the scope of management. For example a frequently used permission that can only be delegated at the domain level is \u0026ldquo;Replicating Directory Changes\u0026rdquo;, which some applications might require to keep a replicated copy of the directory.\nObjectives You want to keep your highly privileged accounts managed and to do that you need to identify them.\nOne of the activities in doing that is to list accounts with critical permissions at the domain root.\n1. Examine access control list and understand what permissions are critical.\n2. Identify accounts and groups that are of importance for our assessment.\n3. List explicit added accounts and accounts granted access by membership in nested groups.\nFILTERING ACE\u0026rsquo;s To do that you can use the AD ACL Scanner. It has both a GUI and a command line mode, cool right? :) First, we will focus on using the command line mode since you easily can pipe the result to any other command you would like to use.\nBoth the command line and the GUI support creating reports in CSV, HTML and EXCEL. For Excel reports you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have Microsoft Office installed. Simply just install the PowerShell module ImportExcel by Doug Finke. Thanks Doug!\nPowerShell Command If you run ADACLScan.ps1 without parameters it will launch the graphical interface, but if you add the properly selected parameters you will run in command mode.\nTo run in command mode, you must add the -base (or the alias for the same -b) parameter and define a starting point using the distinguished name. I will use dc=contoso,dc=com which is the root of my domain.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -base \u0026#34;dc=contoso,dc=com\u0026#34; Our objective is to find any unexpected user accounts with critical permissions on the domain level.\nTo do that we run:\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical | ft And as you can see, we only received the critical permissions.\nBut this result contains a lot of expected users and groups.\nCan we exclude the default permissions? - Yes, we can!\nAdd the parameter -SkipDefaults to filter the result from default permissions.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults | ft Now we have a much shorter list to analyze. In our scenario we have good control of the built-in groups, so we are not interested in listing them here. Both Incoming Forest Trust Builders and Clonable Domain Controllers are groups we monitor and keep track of.\nCan we ignore these built-in groups? - Sure!\nAdd the -SkipBuiltin parameter to the command and it will ignore built-in groups.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn | ft Ok, Now it\u0026rsquo;s just some custom ACE\u0026rsquo;s left. Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s much easier. Right?\nWell, the result contains groups and we need to know what user accounts are critical to the domain root.\nWe need to know who is member of these groups\u0026hellip; and the nested groups\u0026hellip; and the groups nested of these\u0026hellip; and so on\u0026hellip; Sigh!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s fix that! Just add -RecursiveFind.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn -RecursiveFind | ft Awesome, all highly privileged accounts are listed, although we got a couple of additional groups too.\nYou can filter the recursive search to only return users (by default all objects are returned) in the nested group chain with -RecursiveObjectType user.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn -RecursiveFind -RecursiveObjectType user | ft Maybe your results won\u0026rsquo;t be this obvious, but the account name are often a starting point for digging deeper. In this case the user MaliciouseActor really sticks out :)\nGRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE This clip shows how to do the same thing from the graphical user interface. It\u0026rsquo;s really easy!\nStart ADACLScan.ps1 by either right-clicking it and select Run with PowerShell or run the following in the PowerShell window:\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 Summary In this blog post I covered how to scan the domain root of a domain and identify the accounts you might otherwise have missed when listing highly privileged and sensitive accounts in your domain.\nYou can of course run this command through the whole Active Directory, but it might take a while especially if you use excessive group nesting with groups that have many members.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t stop with your built-in groups when assessing your environment. You will probably have users with critical permissions delegated without being member of these groups.\nKeep your identities and credentials managed\nUpcoming Next blog post in this series will cover how to scan linked Group Policies.\n","permalink":"https://mprivdev.github.io/blog/finding-highly-privileged-accounts-in-acls---part-1/","tags":["Security","Active directory","ACL","Assessment","Privileged Account"],"title":"Finding Highly Privileged Accounts in ACL's - Part 1"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AD ACL Scanner Current version Version: 6.0\n9 February, 2020\nSHA256: E50D408747E98CE7575A845DE82234A23A08632D45DEC1AF8FC2BAADF94EE92C\nNew Feature\nNew improved UI More functions available from the command line Scan GPO permissions Filter permissions on criticality [Critical, Warning, Medium, Low, Info] Filter on Default Permissions Filter on Built-in Security Principals Recursive find group members, will list all resulting security principals in the ACL Recursive find filter, filter recursive results [*, User, Group, Computer] Download Release\nDonate Do you appreciate my work and want to buy me a beer?

Export DACLs/SACLs on Active Directory objects in a CSV format. Export DACLs/SACLs on Active Directory objects in a Excel sheet. Connect and browse you default domain, schema , configuration or a naming context defined by distinguishedname. Browse naming context by clicking you way around, either by OU�s or all types of objects. Report only explicitly assigned DACLs/SACLs. Report on OUs , OUs and Container Objects or all object types. Filter DACLs/SACLs for a specific access type.. Where does �Deny� permission exists? Filter DACLs/SACLs for a specific identity. Where does \u0026ldquo;Domain\\Client Admins\u0026rdquo; have explicit access? Or use wildcards like \u0026ldquo;jdoe\u0026rdquo;. Filter DACLs/SACLs for permission on specific object. Where are permissions set on computer objects? Skip default permissions (defaultSecurityDescriptor) in report. Makes it easier to find custom permissions. Report owner of object. Compare previous results with the current configuration and see the differences by color scheme (Green=matching permissions, Yellow= new permissions, Red= missing permissions). Report when permissions were modified Can use AD replication metadata when comparing. Can convert a previously created CSV file to a HTML report. Effective rights, select a security principal and match it agains the permissions in AD. Color coded permissions based on criticality when using effective rights scan. List you domains and select one from the list. Get the size of the security descriptor (bytes). Rerporting on disabled inheritance . Get all inherited permissions in report. HTLM reports contain headers. Summary of criticality for all report types. Refresh Nodes by right-click container object. Exclude of objects from report by matching string to distinguishedName You can take a CSV file from one domain and use it for another. With replacing the old DN with the current domains you can resuse reports between domains. You can also replace the (Short domain name)Netbios name security principals. Reporting on modified default security descriptors in Schema. Verifying the format of the CSV files used in convert and compare functions. When compairing with CSV file Nodes missing in AD will be reported as \u0026ldquo;Node does not exist in AD\u0026rdquo; The progress bar can be disabled to gain speed in creating reports. If the fist node in the CSV file used for compairing can\u0026rsquo;t be connected the scan will stop. Display group members in groups in the HTLM report.

My blog posts at Microsoft was temporarly deleted so just in case I re-post this one here.\nDo you or did you back in the days use your own code or a third party tool to create user accounts that did not update the userAccountControl attribute after the account was created? Well then there\u0026rsquo;s a change you might have accounts in your domain that are allowed blank passwords or even worse have accounts with blank passwords! Why! Because user objects are allowed blank passwords by default when created, something that must be handle afterwards. Unless that\u0026rsquo;s in line with your security policy ;) This is the default setting of userAccountControl at user object creation: userAccountControl: 0x222 = (ACCOUNTDISABLE | PASSWD_NOTREQD | NORMAL_ACCOUNT); How does this setting affect my environment? Q: We have a password policy in our domain that does not allow blank passwords, are we protected from blank passwords? A: No, this setting overrides the password policy in the domain or your fine grained password policy when you do reset password operations.\nSo when is the \u0026ldquo;blank password\u0026rdquo; setting on user accounts effective:\nWhen users are delegated the permissions to do password resets on user accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD, they can set a blank password.\nA normal change password procedure by a user do not follow the ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD, it will follow the password policy in your domain or fine grained password policy if you got defined for the user.\nSo let say that an user with the delegate right to do password reset accidentally press OK in the password reset dialog box without the \u0026ldquo;User must change password at next logon\u0026rdquo; or someone in your organization with permissions to create user objects accentually runs a script that sets blank password. Then you will have accounts in you domain with no password. How do I find accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD? How will I know any of the accounts in my domain have \u0026ldquo;password not required\u0026rdquo; set? The easiest way to do it is to do a search with ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers) mmc snap-in.\nRight click the domain root. Select Find\u0026hellip;. In the Find: drop down box select Custom Search. Click the Advanced tab. In the Enter LDAP Query: field type: (\u0026amp;(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32)). Click Find Now. How to create users To create users without allowing blank passwords you must deal with the userAccountContol values:\n\u0026ldquo;When a new user account is created, the userAccountControl attribute for the account automatically has the UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD flag set, which indicates that no password is required for the account. If the security policies of the domain that the account is created in requires a password for all user accounts, then the UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD flag must be removed from the userAccountControl attribute for the account.\u0026rdquo;\nHere you can read on how to create user accounts:\nCreating a user (Windows)\nPASSWD_NOTREQD flag:\nThis Vbscript code example will create a user with UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. The user will be allowed using blank passwords.\nSet objOU = GetObject(\u0026#34;LDAP://ou=sales,dc=contoso,dc=com\u0026#34;) Set objUser = objOU.Create(\u0026#34;User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cn=jsmith\u0026#34;) objUser.Put \u0026#34;sAMAccountName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;jsmith\u0026#34; objUser.Put \u0026#34;givenName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;james\u0026#34; objUser.SetInfo objUser.put \u0026#34;userPrincipalName\u0026#34;,objUser.sAMAccountName \u0026amp; \u0026#34;@contoso.com\u0026#34; objUser.AccountDisabled = False strPassword = \u0026#34;P@ssW0rdPh@rse\u0026#34; objUser.SetPassword strPassword objUser.SetInfo This Vbscript code example manage the userAccountControl attribute. It removes both the disabled state and \u0026ldquo;password not required\u0026rdquo; setting:\nSet objOU = GetObject(\u0026#34;LDAP://ou=sales,dc=contoso,dc=com\u0026#34;) Set objUser = objOU.Create(\u0026#34;User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cn=jsmith\u0026#34;) objUser.Put \u0026#34;sAMAccountName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;jsmith\u0026#34; objUser.Put \u0026#34;givenName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;james\u0026#34; objUser.SetInfo objUser.put \u0026#34;userPrincipalName\u0026#34;,objUser.sAMAccountName \u0026amp; \u0026#34;@contoso.com\u0026#34; Const ADS_UF_ACCOUNT_DISABLE = 2 Const ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD = 32 intUAc = objUser.Get (\u0026#34;userAccountControl\u0026#34;) objUser.put \u0026#34;userAccountControl\u0026#34;, intUAc And (Not ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD) And (Not ADS_UF_ACCOUNT_DISABLE) strPassword = \u0026#34;P@ssW0rdPh@rse\u0026#34; objUser.SetPassword strPassword objUser.SetInfo How do I know if I got blank passwords and how do I deal with it? Well, you can run a script to test every account against a blank password or why not find users with passwords that don\u0026rsquo;t comply with the password policy and remove the user setting for other users at the same time? :)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a code-sample that remove the ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. If a user has a blank password the script will report an error stating it does not follow the password policy for the domain, as long as you have a password policy in the domain that requires minimum length above zero characters. If the script succeeds it will also report the status of the account, since if the account is also disabled it still could have a blank password.\nYou could test your environment with this code-sample and review the output.\nHopefully you do not have accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. If you do you follow this procedure to find them.\nYou could still of course have accounts with blank passwords in case you had a domain password policy with no minimum password length. To remediate you have to make sure your password policies are in line with you security policy and that users are required to change their passwords and do not have \u0026ldquo;Password never expires\u0026rdquo; ticked in.\n","permalink":"https://mprivdev.github.io/blog/do-you-allow-blank-passwords-in-your-environment/","tags":["security","active directory","password"],"title":"Do You Allow Blank Passwords In Your Environment"}]
